# ClevoKeyboardColor

This program changes the color of the clevo keyboard to match the current focussed window.

I made this for a Clevo NH55RDQ which comes with clevo control center 3.0. I have a single color rgb keyboard, but it should be fairly simple to adapt it to multi zone or per key keyboards. Let me know if you need help with that.

`InsydeDCHU.dll` needs to be added to the same folder as the exe. This file can be found in the installation directory of FnKey from the control center, which can be downloaded [here](https://www.clevo.com.tw/en/e-services/download/ftpOut.asp?Lmodel=NH5x_70RD%2FRC%2FRA%2FRHQ&ltype=9&submit=+GO+).
